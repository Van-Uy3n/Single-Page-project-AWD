        <h2>About BTS</h2>
        <p>BTS, which stands for Bangtan Sonyeondan (translation: Bulletproof Boy            Scouts) in Korean and Beyond the Scene in English, is a sensational South            Korean boy group with seven creative and driven members. They made their             debut on June 12, 2013 from the music company Big Hit Entertainment, which           is now acting as a music label under HYBE Corporation--an entertainment              company Big Hit recently rebranded as. The artistic septet is made up of             rappers and vocalists, and the members are: RM, Jin, Suga, 
        J-Hope, Jimin, V, and Jungkook. Although they are not fully involved in the          production process or credited as the main producers, they do participate in         most of their music. Especially the rappers of the group, all of the members         have helped write, arrange, compose, and/or produce most songs for either            the group or themselves individually.</p>
        
        <br>
        <p>The main attraction to BTS has been profound lyrics and concepts because          listeners have found them relatable and interesting. While anyone of any background can listen to their songs, the target of their music was originally to connect to the youth and express about the youth's identity and experiences in society. Through their                   exploration of themes, fans–known as ARMY (meaning: Adorable Representative          M.C. for Youth)–were inspired with hope and self-worth because the group             helped fans find empowerment or a silver lining; fans also resonated with            and valued the more somber songs. Their song “Spring Day” is especially              loved by the Korean general public because they were touched by the message          of longing after a loss and hope. Furthermore, fans have been captivated by          the BTS Universe, an intricate fictional universe where the members are              individuals dealing with their own struggles and are connected by fate. The storyline is present in some of their music videos, short films, and hightlight reels. Since the storyline is up for interpretation, there are many different theories the fans have come up with. They have fun theorizing the meanings of symbols, scenes, and more. </p>

        <br>
        <p>Originally, the group came from a small company, which meant it was hard for them to be notable without a famous company backing them up. In addition, there were many other active K-Pop groups that caught the public's interest. Because it was competitive to achieve and maintain fame in the K-Pop industry, it was challenging for BTS to be successful after their debut for a couple of years. However, they began to rise to fame in South Korea after they finally won their first award on a music show, “The Show,” for their      song “I Need U” in 2015. Then, BTS gained popularity in the Western music            market, especially the United States, with their song “DNA” in 2017. This led them to be part of and perform at their first American award show: the American Music Awards. Over the next following years to the present, the group has gained more fans, credibility, and prominence domestically and  globally. Their diligence and dedicated fans are credited for their rise to fame and achievements. The fans are a dedicated, strong community. They stream, buy BTS related works and products, create BTS-related content, organize BTS-related events (ex. birthday fundraisers for charity), and more. Without their fans' determination to promote them and help them break records, they would not have the assistance needed to soar higher and higher and maintain a stable career. The group is forever grateful for their fans’ love and always strive to make them happy with their music.</p>

        <h3>LOVE MYSElF</h3>
        <p>Starting in the summer of 2017, BTS released and began their Love Yourself series, which comprised of three albums and one video. Each album journeyed through different types of love: joyful and innocent love, painful love and heartbreak, and self-love. The aim of the series was to tell a story about finding and exploring true love, which was realized to be self-love. The message was to love yourself because accepting your worth and flaws was helpful to yourself and others.</p>
