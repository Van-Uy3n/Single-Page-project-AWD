        <p><b>BTS</b>, which stands for Bangtan Sonyeondan (translation: Bulletproof Boy Scouts) in Korean and Beyond the Scene in English, is a South Korean music group with seven members. They made their debut on June 12, 2013 from the music company Big Hit Entertainment. The members are:</p>
        <ul class="bold">
            <li>RM</li>
            <li>Jin</li>
            <li>Suga</li>
            <li>J-Hope</li>
            <li>Jimin</li>
            <li>V</li>
            <li>Jungkook</li>
        </ul>
        <p>They are considered <i>self-producing idols</i>. Although they are not always involved in the creation process, they do participate in most of it. All of the members have helped write, arrange, compose, and/or produce music for the group or themselves. 
</p>
        <p>The group is also known for their energetic choreography. Captivating the audience, they also perform beautiful dances that convey a story.</p>
        <p>Often, their music explores the identity of young people or comments on society. From their music, fans–known as <b>ARMY</b> (meaning: Adorable Representative M.C. for Youth)–were inspired with hope because the group helped them find empowerment or a silver lining.</p>
        <p>Fans also resonated with and valued their more somber songs. “Spring Day” is their most loved song by the Korean general public because they were touched by the message of longing after a loss and hope</p>
        <p>Furthermore, there is the <b>BTS Universe</b>: a universe where the members are characters, who face individual problems, connected by fate. Since the storyline is up for interpretation, <b>ARMYs</b> devise theories. The storyline is present in some of their:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Music videos</li>
            <li>Short films</li>
            <li>Highlight Reels</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Originally, it was hard for the group to be respected without a famous company backing them up.</p>
        <p>However, they began to rise to fame in South Korea after they finally won their first award on a music show, “The Show,” for their      song “I Need U” in 2015. Then, BTS gained popularity in the Western music            market, especially the United States, with their song “DNA” in 2017. This led them to be part of and perform at their first American award show: the American Music Awards.
</p>
        <p><b>BTS</b>he group gained more fans, credibility, and prominence domestically and globally. Their dedicated fans are also credited for their rise to fame and achievements. They stream, buy BTS related works and products, create BTS-related content, organize BTS-related events (ex. birthday fundraisers for charity), and more.</p>

        <h2>Campaigns</h2>
        
        <h3>Love Myself</h3>
        <p>In 2017, BTS released and began their <i>Love Yourself</i> series, which comprised of three albums (<i>Love Yourself: Her</i>, <i>Love Yourself: Tear</i>, & <i>Love Yourself: Answer</i>) and one video (Love Yourself: Wonder). Each album journeyed through different types of love: joyful and pure love, painful love and heartbreak, and self-love. The aim of the series was to tell a story about finding and exploring true love, which was realized to be self-love.</p>
        <p>The message was to love yourself because accepting your worth and flaws will help you love others.</b> When you can love yourself, you can give that same love to others.</p>
        <p>On November 1, 2017, BTS and Big Hit Entertainment partnered with <b>UNICEF (United Nations Children's Fund)</b> in their <b>#ENDviolence</b> campaign in order to spread the message of self-love. <b>#ENDviolence</b>'s objective was to eradicate violence against children and teens by providing them safety. It was created to promote protection for young people and devise solutions to end violence.</p>
        <p>Thus, the group and its label created the <b>LOVE MYSELF</b> campaign for their partnership with <b>UNICEF</b>. <b>LOVE MYSELF</b> promoted self-love for young children globally. <b>With love, the world can become a better place to live in.</b></p>
        <p>At some concerts, there would be UNICEF and LOVE MYSELF booths set up to teach fans about the cause's message. Fans have contributed to the cause by donating money, sharing their own self-love journeys, and promoting the cause on social media. </p>
        <p>BTS pledged to donate 3% of the album sales for the Love Yourself series and all the proceeds made from the campaign's merchandise. Donations made by them and fans are made towards protecting children from:
    <ul class="bold">
        <li>Domestic violence</li>
        <li>School violence</li>
        <li>Sexual violence</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
